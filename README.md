# RS3 Archaeology Calculator

A web-based calculator for **RS3 Archaeology** that helps players track selected artefacts, manage material storage, and calculate remaining material requirements for restorations.

Just a small project I did for personal use. Feel free to fork it or use it as is. I do not promise a bug free experience.

I do reserve the right to remove it at any time and I hope no one will use my work without attribution. If you fork it and improve upon it and then make it available to the public, I only ask for attribution!

I hope my small project helps the grind!
